## Factorial

> When finding how many(**count**) of any number(3,5,7) are present in a factorial of a number(**100!**). Like below. We were finding the count of **prime** numbers.

> In order to find the count of numbers like 15,10 etc. We need to find the count of **factors** of the number. For example, what we did, when we found out the count of **0's** in a factorial of a number(100!). We have to follow the below process. When we are finding **0's** in a factorial of a number(100!), we are finding the number **10** here, so the factors of **10** are **2 and 5**. Since as **5** is the **bigger factor** of the two, we will use it to find the  count of **0's**.

> When we are finding count of **15's** in a factorial of a number(100!), so the factors of **15** are **2, 3 and 5**. Since as **5** is the **bigger factor** of the two, we will use it to find the  count of **15's**.
