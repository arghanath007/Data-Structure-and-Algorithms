## DBMS Architecture

* It is a three-tier/level architecture:-
  * Logical/Conceptual Level -> It is a very big table(more than 50 columns), some of the columns are visible to a particular user/user-group that is **External**. The table which is stored is **Internal**. 


### What data is stored in the DBMS?

>The type of data stored in database is **Logical**. 

### How data is stored in the DBMS?

> The way data is stored in a database is **Internal**.


## Data Model

> They are the tools which are used to design database models.


## Entity

> A single phone is an entity.

## Entity Set

> All the phones collectively represented is an entity set.

## Attribute

> The properties of an entity are called attributes.
> The characteristics(Name, brand, size, processor, price) of a single phone are called as attributes.
>  Attributes are nothing but to describe an entity(Phone is an entity here).


## Participation Constraints

* **Double Line** is used to represent **Total** participation constraints.
* **Single Line** is used to represent **Partial** participation constraints.
