## introduction-to-compiler-design(1) [28th Sept 2023]

## Introduction

* First compile then we have to run.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/94d141ad-484f-49a2-bda4-f38444fc37b1)

* HLL -> High level Language -> For humans
* LLL -> Low Level Language -> For Computer
* LLL Or machine level language or Assembly language.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/100d91e0-dfbe-4dec-bc79-b40a8e96a8db)

* HLL given to **pre-processor**.
* Output of **pre-processor** is **Pure HLL**.
* Pure HLL -> No shortcuts.
* HLL -> Shortcuts there.
* After **pre-processor** is over, we never see **hash** in the code.

* Compiler input -> Pure HLL.
* Compiler output -> LLL Or machine level language or Assembly language(AL).
* Assembler input ->  Assembly language.
* Assembler output -> Relocatable Assembly language or Relocatable machine level machine or Relocatable LLL.

* **Assembler** will make sure that **code** can move anywhere.
* If we don't do **assembler** then maybe we will loose the data.

* Relocatable Assembly language or Relocatable machine level machine or Relocatable LLL -> All **three names** are **similar**.
* In a project we have **many programs**.
* They are compiled **individually** and **individually** assembled.

* Linker.
* Single Relocatable-Assembly language.
* Loader -> Loading program from Hard-disk(HDD) to main memory(MM).
* The program is in main memory(MM), the file is called as **exc or executable** file.

* Between ready and running state, who will come first?

> **Ready state** will come **first**.

* First we should be **ready**.
* Before **ready state** we have **new state**, which is making **one process**.

* Termination State.

* Waiting State.
* Input interrupt
* Output interrupt.

* [**IMPORTANT**]
* **Exc** came means that the program is in **main memory** and it is ready for running state, just processor is required.

* The different states are not needed here. Shown just for explaination.
* We cannot go directly to **loader** without going to **linker**.
* We have to go to **linker** first and from **linker** then we will go to **loader**.

* **Pre-processor** purpose is replacing **shortcut** by **actual code**.

* yes.

* The entire story is called as **language processing**.
* In the entire **language processing**, who is there after **compiler**?

> Assembler, Linker, Loader.

* They are called as **cousins of compiler**.

* Linking done compile time or linking done running time, which is better?

> We can do it in **both times**. Doing it in **Compile time** is **better**.

* Doing **linking** in **Compile time** is called as **static linking**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* Doing **linking** in **running time or runtime** is called as **dynamic linking**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* Depending on requirement do **linking**.
* Really needed link it that is **dynamic linking**.
* Blindly link first and go that is **static linking**.
* **Static linking** will sometimes **waste space**.
* Which is more important, Space important or CPU time?

> CPU time is more important. [**IMPORTANT**]

* Normally linking is done at **compilation time**. [**IMPORTANT**]
