* What is the difference between Algo and Procedure?

> A well defined procedure is called an **algo**.

* Any procedure which satiesfies the following(above) **criteria/points** then they are called as **algorithms**.
* What is the min. no. of inputs required to run an algo and produce an output? [**IMPORTANT**]

> **Zero or more inputs**. Min. no. of inputs required is **zero(0)**.   

* **OS** is a **Procedure**. It is because of the **finiteness** point. As long as we don't turn off the **PC**, the **OS** will keep on running **infinitely/indefinitely**. That's why it is **not an algo** it is a **procedure**. It is not going to turn off **automatically**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* Definiteness -> Unique Output/result.

* There exists **more than one algo** to solve a particular problem.
* For that we need to do **analysis** of the **algorithms**. We have to find **time Complexity and space complexity**.

* Time and Space Complexities.

* Behavior of Algo.
* Between the **time and space** complexity, we should give **more preference** to **time complexity**. [By Default]
* Best Case -> Min. amt. of time required to run an algo. [Lower Bound
* Worst Case -> Max. amt. of time required to run an algo. [Upper Bound]
* Avg Case ->

* Cases.
* Whenever we need to **analyze** two algos and then we need to make a decision which algo is the **best/better** then we should go with the **average case**.
* **First** we focus on the **average case**.
* **Average case** calculation is **tough** but it will give us the **best analysis/decision** between the **two algos**.
* **Average case** -> Worst Case -> Best Case -> Time Complexity -> Space Complexity.

* Python.
* DS to Algo
* **DS** supported by **python programming language**.

* Python.

* LLL -> Low Level Language.
* Binary Language.
* Assembler.
* Compiler.
* Assembly Language.

* Good Point.
* Keywords in **C-programming** -> 32.
* Words in English Language -> We can't count, too many -> Much Much more than 32(>>>>>>32).

* Hindi/English are very vast languages.
* 'C' is a very small language with only 32 keywords.
* To make a **compiler** for just vast languages(Hindi/English) is possible but the **point** will come when we will give **some input** to the **compiler** and the **compilation** will take a **lot of time(very slow)** to give **output** for the **inputs**. **output** will come after sometime.
* English has **many ambigious words** which have **more than one meaning**.

* Finally it is anyways converted into **bianry(0,1) language** because machine understands **bianry(0,1) language** only.
