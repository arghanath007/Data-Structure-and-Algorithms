* Machine Learning
* We will give some **input** to the **ML model** and we will get some **output**. The **output** will be based on the **previously trained model** and the **type of input** that is given to the **model**.
* We need to design a **model** and the model will be created based on different type of learnings. The model is created based on the analysis of the **data**.
* We have given **data** to the model and sometimes we send **output** with the **input** sometimes only the **input** is given to the model and the model is made to **predict** on the **input**.
* Finally the aim is to **design the model**.

* It provides **feedback** to the model. [**VERY IMPORTANT**] 
* In **Unsupervised learning** we are **not teaching** much to the **model**, it is **learning itself** only by doing **analysis**. It is using it's own **analysis** and it's own **brain** to do the **predictions**. [**VERY IMPORTANT**] 
* In **supervised learning** we are **teaching** most or everything to the **model** and it is **not learning itself**. It is not using it **brain**. It is using the things that it has **learned** via **training** on the **training data**. [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* **Semi-supervised** learning it contains mixture/combination of both the **labeled and unlabeled** data.

* Underfit and Overfit. [**IMPORTANT**]
* Variance and bias. [**IMPORTANT**]
* **Underfit** -> In both the **training and the test** datasets it is not giving the **best results/outputs**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* **Overfit** -> The model has **trained** very well or too well on the **training set** but it is not able to perform **better** on the **test dataset**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* The **model** should never be either **underfit** or **overfit**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* **Good fit/Robust** -> The **datapoints** should be **near** the **line**.

* Overfitting [Example]
* The model is just **remembering** the **training dataset** instead of **learning** from the **training dataset**. [Example]
* The model has trained too well on the **training dataset** but it is not able to perform on the **test dataset**.

* In **Overfitting** we will get the problem of **high variance** which means that the model is failing on the **test dataset**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* In **Overfitting**, the **bias** will be **low bias**. [**IMPORTANT**]

* Underfitting [Example]
* The model is either performing on the **training or the test** dataset. [Example]

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/8d56317d-dc31-4e0e-84ab-3f3b4cd5af46)

* In **Underfitting** we will get the problem of **high bias** which means that the model is failing on the **training  dataset**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* In **Underfitting**, the **variance** will be **high variance** most probably because as it is failing on the **training  dataset**, the model will definitely fail on the **test dataset** as well. [**IMPORTANT**]

### Bias

* We will use the **variance** word when we are talking about **testing dataset**. [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* For the **Good Ft/Robust** we will have **low bias** and it also has **low variance** as well. [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* Question
* The model is doing **Underfitting**.
* **Higher number** means **better results**.

* Question
* The model is doing **Overfitting**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* It is because we are getting **more accuracy** in the **training dataset** and we are getting **significantly less accuracy** in the **test dataset** which is the sign of **Overfitting**.

* Question
* The model is doing **underfitting**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* It is beacuse the **training and the test** error percentages are too **high** for the model to be any usuable.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/b143343e-689e-4a5d-ae92-976bdae9af7e)

* Question
* The model is doing **Good fit/robust**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* It is beacuse the **training and the test** error percentage are almost identical which is **less than 1%** difference in between them and the percentage of error overall is less than **5%** which is very impressive.

* Example. [**VERY IMPORTANT**]
* As there are based on **error %** so we choose the **lower number** being **better**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* If they were given based on **accuracy %** then we choose the **hgher number** being **better**. [**IMPORTANT**]
