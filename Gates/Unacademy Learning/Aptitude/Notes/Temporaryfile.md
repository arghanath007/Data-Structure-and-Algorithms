## Permutation combination probability part-I

* Where ever there is a **choice**, we want to select two black markers **or** three red markers. We want to select three boys **or** four girls.
* Where ever there is a **choice**, we say **OR**. In all such cases we use **plus(+)** and we use **union(U)** if we are studying **probability**.

* When there is **no choice**, we want to select two black markers **and** three red markers. We want to select three boys **and** four girls.
* When there is **no choice**, we use **multiplication( * )** and in probability we use **intersection(n)**.

* Using **1, 2 and 3**, we are asked to make **two digit nos**.

### Repetition Allowed

* **Two digit nos** means we want **unit digit and tens digit place** as well.
* For **two digit nos** we need **both units place and tens place**. As **AND** that's why **multiply**. [**Point 2**]

> As **Repetition allowed**, we are writing **1/2/3** in both **unit's and ten's place**. That's why **3 * 3**.

* For **Repetition allowed**, the two digit no -> **3 * 3 -> 9**.

### Repetition not allowed

* In the **unit's place** we are writing **1/2/3** and we can put **3** there. 
* For the **ten's place**, we are writing **1/2/3** as well but when writing the **ten's place**, we will **remove one no** or do **-1** as **one value** was already used in the **unit's place** as **repetition** not allowed, that's why putting **2** at the **ten's place**.
* For **Repetition not allowed**, the two digit no -> **2 * 3 -> 6**.

* Repetition allowed.
* In **three digit nos.**, we need all three **unit's place and ten's place and hundred's place** that's why **multiply**.

* Repetition not allowed.
* In **Repetition not allowed**, in the **ten's place** we are removing the unit's place no that's why **5 - 1 = 4**. At the **hundred's place** we are removing both the **unit and ten's** place no. that's why **5 - 2 = 3**.

> If at the **unit place**, **1 or 2** was taken then we have to put **1** at the **tenth place**. We will get **1 * 3 -> 3**.

> There is also another case that if people start from the **tenth place** then we can put **2** at the tenth place and **2** at the **unit place** because we are removing the no, we have put at the **tenth place**. We are getting **2 * 2 -> 4**.

* We already know that at the **tenth place** we can put **1 or 2** only as we can't put **0** at the **tenth place**.

> When we are solving **permutation and combination**, always attack the **case** at the very **first** place. Attack the **condition** at the very first place.

> The people who started from the **tenth place** got the **right/correct** answer because **zero(0)** must not come at the **tenth place**. As they have taken care of the **zero(0)** at the **very first place**, there is no doubt at the **unit's place**.
> Which is **2 * 2 -> 4**.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/192af0d5-fad6-4413-b914-443f45d2793f)

> The people starting from the **unit's place** is that, based on what we are putting at the **unit's place**, the value at the **tenth place** is changing. We can either put **zero(0)** at the **unit's place** or put **non-zero** at the **unit's place**.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/49a839ea-4335-4aa5-970e-933d480586de)

> On the **left hand side**, where we have taken **zero(0)** at the **unit's place**, we have take either **1 or 2** at the **tenth place**, so we can put **2** at the tenth place as we have **two choices(1 or 2)** and **1** at the unit's place as we have take **zero(0)** at the **unit's place**. So, **2 * 1 = 2**.

> > On the **right hand side**, where we have taken **non-zero(1 or 2)** at the **unit's place**, we have take either **1 or 2** at the **tenth place** whichever is not taken in the **unit's place**, so we can put **1** at the tenth place as we have **one choice(whichever not used in unit's place)** and **2** at the **unit's place** as we have take **1 or 2** at the **unit's place**, so we have **two choices**. So, **1 * 2 = 2**.

* So, the overall is **2 + 2 = 4**.

### Conclusion

1) In **permutation and combination**, always attack the **condition** at the **first place**. 
2) If condition is given, then **sort** the conditions and after **sorting** go to the **very first place**. If **repetition is allowed or not allowed**, if there is **zero or no zero**, once we are **done/satisfied** with the **condition**, we will go to the **very first place**.

> If **zero(0)** is involved then there will be **one extra case**.

* Sir's way. [**IMPORTANT**]

* As **2 ^ 1 = 2**, so the divisibility rule of **2** is the **last digit** as the **power** is **1**.
* As **2 ^ 2 = 4**, so the divisibility rule of **4** is the **last two digits** as the **power** is **2**.
* As **2 ^ 3 = 8**, so the divisibility rule of **8** is the **last three digits** as the **power** is **3**.
* As **2 ^ 4 = 16**, so the divisibility rule of **16** is the **last four digits** as the **power** is **4**.
* As **2 ^ n**, so the divisibility rule of **2 ^ n** is the **last 'n' digits** as the **power** is **n**.

> So the **divisibility rule of a no.**, depends on the **power**.

* **Repetition**:-
* **Divisibility rule of 4** -> Last two digits -> 2 ^ 2 = 4.
* That's why we **fixed** the **unit and tenth place** digits **together**.
* So, we are taking the **unit and tenth place** digits **together**.
* We have got **4 cases** among the range of **1/2/3/4** where **Divisibility rule of 4** matches. 
* **Hundredth place** is **independent** of **conditions**. That's why we put **1-4** and **4**.
* For the **unit and tenth place** digits **together**, we got **4 cases**, so we put **4**.
* Total -> **4 * 4** -> **16**.
 
 ![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/c1b5de4d-b11a-4cbc-bc53-4fd363757793)

* **No Repetition**:-
* We cannot take **44** as **4** is being **repeated**.
* We got **3** cases for the **unit and tenth** place.
* We have **1 non-zero(NZ)** value at the **unit place** and **1 non-zero(NZ)** value at the **tenth place**.
* So, we have **4** conditions for the **Hundredth place** but **2 non-zero(NZ)** values are used in **unit and tenth** place, that why **4 - 2 = 2**.
* Total -> **2 * 3 -> 6**.

* **2 and 5** divisibility rule.
* **5** is the **brother** of **2**.
* **5** works same as **2** only.
* **Divisibility rule** of **5**.

* 5 ^ 1 = 5, as **power = 1**, so the **divisibility rule** is **last digit or last 1 digit**.
* 5 ^ 2 = 25, as **power = 2**, so the **divisibility rule** is **last '2' digit**.
* 5 ^ 3 = 125, as **power = 3**, so the **divisibility rule** is **last '3' digit**.
* 5 ^ 4 = 625, as **power = 4**, so the **divisibility rule** is **last '4' digit**.

## Permutation combination probability part-IV (16) [17th June 2023]

## Permutation and combination

## Combination

1) Meaning -> Selection
2) Example -> 

* To select one person among 3 people -> **3 ways**
* To select two person among 3 people -> **3 ways**
* To select three person among 3 people -> **1 way**


## Permutation 

1) Meaning -> Selection followed by Arrangement (Selection + Arrangement)
2) Example -> 

* When arranging one person, then

1) First we select. It is done in **3 ways**. 

* When arranging two people, then

1) First we select. It is done in **6 ways**. 
 
* When arranging three people, then

1) First we select. It is done in **6 ways**.

* In all of the above three cases, we were asked to make **3-letter** words.

* In the **first case**, where **A/B/C**, there is **no repetition** of any letter so **3C3 * 3! -> 6**.
* In the **second case**, where **A/A/B**, there is **repetition** of letter **A** and it is coming **two** times, so **(3C3 * 3!)/ 2! -> 3!/2! -> 6/2 -> 3**.
* In the **third case**, where **A/A/A**, there is **repetition** of letter **A** and it is coming **three** times, so **(3C3 * 3!)/ 3! -> 3!/3! -> 1**.

* In **conclusion**, the no. of times, the **letter** is repeated, we are diving with that **nos's factorial**. If letter is repeated **two** times then **divide** by **2!**.
* If letter is repeated **three** times then **divide** by **3!**.

* For **AMAN**, as **4-letter** word, so we did **4!** but **letter 'A'** is repeated **two** times, so we are **dividing**, **4!** with **2!**, which is **4!/ 2! -> 24/2 -> 12**.
