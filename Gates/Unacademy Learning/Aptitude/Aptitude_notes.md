## Perfect Square

* UDV -> Unit Digit Value
* PC -> Power Cycle

> Perfect square has **0,1,4,5,6 and 9** as their unit digit values only.
> **2,3,7 and 8** are not possible as unit digit values in perfect square.

## Power Cycle

> The *highest power* of a number is called it's *Power Cycle* till we are getting unique values in the unit's place.

8^1=8
8^2=64
8^3=512
8^4=4096
8^5=32768

> The Unit digit of *8^5* is same as that of *8^1*. Hence the PC or power cycle of 8 is *4*. The UDV of 8 is *6*.

### Odd and Even power.

> (Odd Number)^(anything) -> Odd.
> Any power of an odd number gives **odd number** only.

> (Even Number)^(anything) -> Even.
> Any power of an even number gives **even number** only.

## Factorial

> In any *factorial number*, let's say *N!*, number of *zeroes(0)* at the end is as good as number of *5's* present.

### Last Two(2) digits

> Any power of **5** gives **25** as the last two digits always.

### Last Two(2) digits when *UDV=1*

> First, take the unit digit value of the number(1) here and put it as the unit digit value of the answer. Secondly take the tens place of the unit digit value of the number(2) here and multiply it with the unit digit value of the power(3) here. We are already have **1** at unit's place and multiplying *2 and 3* gives *6* which is the value at the tens place of the answer. Hence we get **61** as the answer.
> We would get -> **61**

> Focus on the number of digits asked in the question.

**Important**

* N! >= 5!, UDV is always equal to **zero(0)**.
* From 5! every factorial has unit place as **zero(0)**.
* >= 5! UDV is always equals to **zero(0)**. 

### Last Two(2) digits when *UDV !=1 OR UDV not equals to 1* Part **1**

> We are using them here. 3|7|9. We have to make **1** which is the common philosophy for all three of them. 
#### Last Two(2) digits when *UDV =3*

#### Last Two(2) digits when *UDV =9*

#### Last Two(2) digits when *UDV =7*

### Last Two(2) digits when *UDV !=1 OR UDV not equals to 1* Part **2**

> We are using them here. 2|4|8|6. We have to make **1** which is the common philosophy for all three of them. 

#### Last Two(2) digits when *UDV =2*

#### Last Two(2) digits when *UDV =4*

#### Last Two(2) digits when *UDV =6*
