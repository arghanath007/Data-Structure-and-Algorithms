## Perfect Square

* UDV -> Unit Digit Value
* PC -> Power Cycle

> Perfect square has **0,1,4,5,6 and 9** as their unit digit values only.
> **2,3,7 and 8** are not possible as unit digit values in perfect square.

## Power Cycle

> The *highest power* of a number is called it's *Power Cycle* till we are getting unique values in the unit's place.

8^1=8
8^2=64
8^3=512
8^4=4096
8^5=32768

> The Unit digit of *8^5* is same as that of *8^1*. Hence the PC or power cycle of 8 is *4*. The UDV of 8 is *6*.

### Odd and Even power.

> (Odd Number)^(anything) -> Odd.
> Any power of an odd number gives **odd number** only.

> (Even Number)^(anything) -> Even.
> Any power of an even number gives **even number** only.

## Factorial

> In any *factorial number*, let's say *N!*, number of *zeroes(0)* at the end is as good as number of *5's* present.



## Scratch Board


9 6
8*3*3*8
9*4
16 -> 6(udv)
1+6+1 -> 8
1+2+7+4= 14=4(B)
