## Introduction to computer networks and ip addressing (1) [27th June 2023]

* Whenever a process tries to get some information from some other process, the process which **sends the information** is called as the **server**. The process which **takes the information** is called as the **client**.

* Process is nothing but a program which is running.

> Client will sent a request when writing **www.google.com**, the request has to go to the process via server.

* Steps:-

1) Identifying the Network
2) Identifying the host within the network
3) Identifying the process within the host.

* IP address is going to have **two** parts

1) Network ID -> It is used to identify the **newtork**.
2) Host ID -> It is used to identify the **host**.

* Socket No -> This is used to identify the **process**.

* IP -> Internet Protocol.

* Yes

* What happens when we type **www.google.com**?

> In my network, we have the ISP. It is the responsibility of your ISP to provide us with one more server network called as **DNS(Domain name server)**.

* What is the purpose of DNS?

> If we have to contact google, we need the IP address of google servers, but we don't know the IP address of google servers, we only know the domain name.
> Before contacting google, we have to contact the **DNS** and **DNS** is going to us the IP address.
> We are giving **domain name** to DNS and we are getting the IP address in return.
> Before we actually communicate with the server, we communicate with the **DNS**.

* For the communication between me sending the **domain name** and getting the IP address in return, this takes **some time**. This time is **wasted** and it is actually unnecessary. It is called as **DNS overhead**.   

* ISP -> Internet Service Provider
* DNS -> Domain name server.
