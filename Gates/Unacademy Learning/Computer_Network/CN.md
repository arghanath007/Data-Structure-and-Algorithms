* Whenever a process tries to get some information from some other process, the process which **sends the information** is called as the **server**. The process which **takes the information** is called as the **client**.

* Process is nothing but a program which is running.

> Client will sent a request when writing **www.google.com**, the request has to go to the process via server.

* Steps:-

1) Identifying the Network
2) Identifying the host within the network
3) Identifying the process within the host.

* IP address is going to have **two** parts

1) Network ID
2) Host ID
