# DBMS

## Important Notes

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/cf8717dd-85a6-4267-a7dd-0a48ba9d6984)

* Disadvantages of DBMS.
* **Mutual Exclusion(ME)** is there in **Concurrent-Access Anomalies**.

## View of Data

1) **Physical Level** -> When the DBMS will store the database, where ever the database is stored is called as the **physical level**. The level where the database is actually stored in the disk.

2) **Logical Level** -> All of the tables, the details of the tables, the details of the items stored in the tables. Everything in front of my eyes. 

3) **View Level** -> The way it is filtered to be seen by the users on the website. Seen by the users. Part of **logical level**.

* Who will see logical level?

> Not the **user**. The creator/maker of the database.

> Everything will be stored in the disk, but we don't know where it is **stored**. The tool(DBMS) only knows where the database is stored in the disk/memory.

* From the logical level can we see the physical level info?

> **NO**. In-between there is the DBMS tool.

* **Physical level** is hidden from the **logical level**.
* From **view level**, **logical level** is **hidden**.
* Commit -> To make the changes permanent we use **commit**.
* Rollback -> Revert back all of the changes and go back to the last state where the DB was saved/committed(before the changes were made).

* No.

* Atomicity happens on a complete transaction.

* We have created a file and we have not saved the file ourselves and there is no auto-save option as well. We have closed that file. What will happen?

> All the data is gone. This is called as **atomicity**.

*  Atomicity -> **Full commit** if we **saved** the file otherwise the data in the file is lost(zero(0)). It is fully **automatic**, we didn't do anything.
* Atomicity -> Automatic rollback to the previous value, done by the DBMS tool.

> When the transactions stops in the **middle**, fails. It is called as **Atomicity**.

* Rollback -> We can rollback to a previous state when we wish like it until a commit is done.

* Yes
* Rollback -> The DB changes can be reverted to previously saved state.
* NULL -> It is a representation of no any value present.

* Entity -> Object in the real world that is distinguishable from another object.
* Entity Set -> A **collection** of similar entities is called as entity set.
* 1 Teacher -> Entity
* Collection of all teachers -> Entity-set
* An attribute or set of attributes whose values can uniquely identify an entity in a set.

* If one entity in the relationship is showing relationship of more than one on the right side then it is **One to Many** relationship.
* Towards the **one** side put an **arrow**. The other side is the **many**.

* Multiple educator can teach one course
* One educator can teach multiple courses.

## Participation Constraints

* Specifies the presence of an entity when it is related to another entity in a relationship type.

1) Total participation -> All entities of an entity set are participating in a relationship
2) Partial participation -> Not all entities are participating.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/4803a7bd-9e6c-4f79-ae2e-55e5f48e326c)

* Example.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/541e6947-2a17-423e-885d-bf214bde6813)

* Question
* Option C.
* **Rent payment** is not soly on **Person** because it is dependent on what room the person has booked. It is not solely on the **Hotel room** as well because the **rent price** of the **hotel rooms** chance from person to person.
* So, **Rent payment** is an **description attribute** which is possible because of the **relationship** between the **Hotel room and Person**.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/8fb099db-b0fd-48d7-bea9-db2f14c0a8de)

* Option **A**.
* Drawing the **set diagram** will make the questions easier to solve. [**IMPORTANT**]
* Cardinality -> No. of entries in entity set. [**IMPORTANT**]

## Weak or Strong Entity

* A weak entity is an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by it's attributes alone.
* A weak entity set does not have a **key**. 

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/73948681-bbe6-4131-b24d-d7a6c60f6a6c)

* Weak entity set is marked with **double rectangular box** around it.
* Every **dependent** doesn't need to be given a **new ID**. It doesn't have it's own **ID**.
* Two weak entity set cannot make a **relationship**.
* One is a strong entity set and one is a weak entity set then the **relationship** is **weak**.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/9e088de0-0ac4-4fa8-a788-c8c8e62c7a1e)

* **Weak relationship** -> Double Diamonds box.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/be8e254f-10b4-4eff-a2be-911589c1681c)

* True.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/8cd0eb5c-259e-4aae-9bb9-22ab930ec04c)

* One Singer can sing many songs.
* In one song many singers possible
* So, **Many to Many** relationship. [Example]
* Songs has **total participation**, as songs cannot be created without singers.
* Singer has **total participation** as well, as singer has **sung** songs that's why he is a singer.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/214e3990-7572-42ed-b040-2ab58fcbb361)

* One customer can buy many products
* One product can be bought by many customers
* That's why **many to many**.
* Not necessary that all customers buys products, that's why **partial participation** in **customers** entity set.
* Not necessary that all products are bought by customers, that's why **partial participation** in **products** entity set.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/9c5aa40a-6112-4686-a507-6529a227ed88)

* One children can go to many schools, different times(Secondary from one school, higher secondary from another school)
* One School can have many children.
* So, **many to many** relationship.
* Not necessary that all children go to school, that's why **partial participation** in **children** entity set.
* It is necessary that all schools have children, that's why **total participation** in **school** entity set.

* Total participation

## Total and Partial Participation

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/2e6a7437-bd47-4032-86b2-481930f59eda)

* Total and partial participation.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/592c54ca-b7df-4618-aaf5-58cbc8a05a42)

* Strong and weak entity set.
* Weak entity set participation in a **relationship** will always be **total participation**. [**IMPORTANT**]

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/85e1499f-c2f2-4752-9726-0908aee22b4a)

* Yes.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/5a455248-cb71-4fc6-b92a-33c1c7d96ce1)

* Dominant Entity -> Entity of strong entity set
* Subordinate Entity -> Entity of weak entity set.
* If one **entity** of **Employee entity set** which is **strong entity set** then it is called as **Dominant Entity**.
* If one **entity** of **dependents entity set** which is **weak entity set** then it is called as **Subordinate Entity**.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/af7fa60b-aa85-4c9b-b96a-fb7663918ea5)

* Both the **Dominant and Subordinate** terms will come into **existence** when we are talking about the **above relationship** of **Employee and dependents** which is a relationship between a **strong entity set(Employee)** and **weak entity set(dependents)**.
* If we take one **entity** and not the whole set from the **strong entity set(Employee)** then it is called as **Dominant entity**.
* If we take one **entity** and not the whole set from the **weak entity set(Dependents)** then it is called as **subordinate entity**.

## Types of Attributes

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/e69b49c3-fb94-42a6-9993-a88026038068)

* Types.

## Single VS Multi-values attributes

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/aa284105-aca8-4ed4-96f0-e31f2e341818)

* Single Valued -> Single value possible for each entity(Rno, name, dob).
* Multi valued -> Multiple values possible for one entity(Phone no).
* To draw **Multi valued**, we need to put **double circle/ellipse** around the value in ER diagram.

## Simple VS Composite/Compound attribute

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/0c42a89e-23c4-482c-8f35-ae59e51d5429)

* Attributes we have that can be decomposed into more attributes then those attributes are called as **composite attributes**.
* Simple -> Single attribute cannot be decomposed into further attributes.
* Simple -> Cannot be decomposed
* Composite/Compound -> Can be decomposed into other attributes(fullname).
* We have **4** attributes here, **Rno, fullname, dob, address**.
* **fullname** is a **composite attribute** of **firstname, middlename, last name**.

## Given VS Derived attributes

* Given -> Given in entity set
* Derived -> Derived from other attributes(age) -> Dotted lines.
* **Age** can be derived from **dob**.
* **Age** is not a direct part of the database. We are showing that **age** can be derived from different attributes.

## Prime VS Non-prime attributes

* Prime -> Part of key
* Non-prime -> Not part of key.
* To represent **prime attributes**, we will put an **underline** under the **prime attributes**.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/78326356-f31d-4fb9-b849-d01854b4f68d)

* Prime VS Non-prime attributes

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/893c4836-54f3-42ff-850c-e0edcd19dd5e)

* Rollno -> Prime attribute
* fullname -> Composite attribute
* Phoneno -> Multivalue attribute
* dob -> Normal attribute
* Age -> Derived attribute
* [**IMPORTANT**]

* No.

## Extended ER features

Specialization -> Specializing the information of an entity set.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/ccfdc497-89aa-4fed-8fd2-735315a1b54b)

* Specialization

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/7cb0ee16-158e-4e1b-b3cd-194cdc9a7bf0)
![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/b9ce0269-1641-45d1-81d3-36a55bd5b7fc)

* Generalization

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/92e16d2a-8369-428b-a65d-bad65ac32bfd)

* Example.  [**IMPORTANT**]
* Vehicle is a **2-wheeler** and **4-wheeler** -> **Specialization**
* **2-wheeler** and **4-wheeler** are **vehicles** only -> **Generalization**.
* In one **entity set**, we are specializing two different **special categories**.
* When we are going towards **specialization**, we have to make the **special categories** when the **specialized entity sets** have some **special attributes**. 
* If there is no **special attributes** for the **specialized entity sets** then there is no point in creating the **special categories**. 
* Top to bottom is **specialization**
* Bottom to Top is **generalization**.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/3a0370f8-8ea8-4dfd-8ec0-0386c3620d8b)

1) **Disjoint set** -> Any entity which is **mutual exclusively** going to either one of the **specialized entity sets**. One entity of higher-level entity set is present in only one lower-level entity set. 

* One entity of higher-level entity set(**Vehicle**) is present in only one lower-level entity set(**2-wheeler** and **4-wheeler**).

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/0760679d-dac6-43d9-95ac-61caf3fb1427)

* Vehicle will be either **2-wheeler** or **4-wheeler**.

2) **Overlapping** -> Present in more than one. One entity of higher-level entity set can be present in more than one lower-level entity set.

* One entity of higher-level entity(Musician) set can be present in more than one lower-level entity sets(**singer** and **guitarist**).

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/92d318d9-3926-411d-a1ea-c6df6d1379e0)

* Musician can be **singer** and **guitarist** as well.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/1e40012d-a6e2-4fda-8e03-1ad74cae8229)

* **Total Generalization or specialization** -> Each higher-level entity must belong to a lower-level entity set.
* **Partial Generalization or specialization** -> Some higher-level entity may not belong to any lower-level entity set.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/7fe7fa46-be30-425e-8694-02921c481446)

## Attribute Inheritance

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/0dc427c9-efbe-4ced-a3eb-64669335a48c)

* Employee entity set -> 4 attributes -> Name, street, city, salary
* Customer entity set -> 4 attributes -> name, street, city, credit_rating.
* Inheritance is **top to bottom** only.

## Aggregation

* Relationships is shown between **entity sets**.
* Relationships-set participating in relationship then aggregation is used.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/5c94919a-f0b6-492d-bf0e-2194e0791b8b)

* Example

* Wrong way.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/19a01fbf-c886-48e8-b4d2-522e9ea16c33)

* Correct way.

* The manager is not **managing** individual job, employee or branch. **Manager** manages the already exisiting relationship.
* We want to show a relationship of a relationship with a different entity set is called as **Aggregation**.
