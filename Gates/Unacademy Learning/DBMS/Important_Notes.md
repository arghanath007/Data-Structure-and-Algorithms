* Disadvantages of DBMS.
* **Mutual Exclusion(ME)** is there in **Concurrent-Access Anomalies**.

## View of Data

1) **Physical Level** -> When the DBMS will store the database, where ever the database is stored is called as the **physical level**. The level where the database is actually stored in the disk.

2) **Logical Level** -> All of the tables, the details of the tables, the details of the items stored in the tables. Everything in front of my eyes. 

3) **View Level** -> The way it is filtered to be seen by the users on the website. Seen by the users. Part of **logical level**.

* Who will see logical level?

> Not the **user**. The creator/maker of the database.

> Everything will be stored in the disk, but we don't know where it is **stored**. The tool(DBMS) only knows where the database is stored in the disk/memory.

* From the logical level can we see the physical level info?

> **NO**. In-between there is the DBMS tool.

* **Physical level** is hidden from the **logical level**.
* From **view level**, **logical level** is **hidden**.
* Commit -> To make the changes permanent we use **commit**.
* Rollback -> Revert back all of the changes and go back to the last state where the DB was saved/committed(before the changes were made).

* No.

* Atomicity happens on a complete transaction.

* We have created a file and we have not saved the file ourselves and there is no auto-save option as well. We have closed that file. What will happen?

> All the data is gone. This is called as **atomicity**.

*  Atomicity -> **Full commit** if we **saved** the file otherwise the data in the file is lost(zero(0)). It is fully **automatic**, we didn't do anything.
* Atomicity -> Automatic rollback to the previous value, done by the DBMS tool.

> When the transactions stops in the **middle**, fails. It is called as **Atomicity**.

* Rollback -> We can rollback to a previous state when we wish like it until a commit is done.

* Yes
* Rollback -> The DB changes can be reverted to previously saved state.
* NULL -> It is a representation of no any value present.

2) Non-procedurals(Declarative) DMLs -> SQL

* Entity -> Object in the real world that is distinguishable from another object.
* Entity Set -> A **collection** of similar entities is called as entity set.
* 1 Teacher -> Entity
* Collection of all teachers -> Entity-set
* An attribute or set of attributes whose values can uniquely identify an entity in a set.
* More than **one attribute** can come into a **key**. 
* Prime Attribute/Key attribute -> All attributes which are part of key.
