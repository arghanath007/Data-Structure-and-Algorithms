## Introduction (1) [7th Feb 2023]

* We have to convert the analog signal into digital form and again digital signal is converted to analog form.

### Analog Signal

> If we take any point at value in **time(t)**, we have an amplitude like signal. This type of signal is **analog signal**.
> **Amplitude** of a signal is the **strength/energy** of a signal. **y-axis** parameter is called as the **amplitude**.

### Digital Signal

> If the digital signals takes only **two possible amplitudes**, then it is called as **Binary Digital Signal**. Eg: *Yes:No*, *0:1*. Two possibilities only like these. 

* At **input location** we should do **analog to digital** and at the **output location** we should do **digital to analog** conversion takes place for any device.
* For off all, we have to convert the **analog to digital** form then only out computers/systems are able to process/understand it. **All processes** can be done with **digital** signals only. But to understand the signals first of all, we need to convert the **analog signal to digital** form.

> We are using the 2's values now which are **0 and 1** only.
> All **analog systems** are replaced with **digital systems** but before that, we have to convert the **analog** to **digital form**.

## Logic Systems

> Here, the beauty of the system is that we don't want exact value. We just have to say **High or Low** i.e **1 or 0** that is enough for us.

### Positive logic system

> We have to compare the given **two** values and whichever is **high** is the **Logic '1'** and whichever is **low** is the **Logic '0'**.


### Negative logic system

> We have to compare the given **two** values and whichever is **high** is the **Logic '0'** and whichever is **low** is the **Logic '1'**.

## Duality

> To convert a **Positive logic system** into a **Negative logic system** we use the concept of **duality**.

### Priority

* Bracket() > AND gate(*) > OR gate(+)

## Boolean Algebra

> It is an analysis tool.

### OR-operator

> If we **add** anything with **1** (A + 1 -> 1), we will get **1** only.

* **(1 + Anything) -> 1**

## Law of Boolean Algebra

### Transposition Theorem(T-1)

* For **T1** to apply the condition is **13 + 24** and when **1 and 3** positions should be **same**. 

### Transposition Theorem(T-2)

* For **T2** to apply the condition is **14 + 23** and when **1 and 3** positions should be **complement** to each other.

* If **1 and 3** both are **same** then **T1**. Steps are different **13 + 24*.
* If **1 and 3** both are **complement** to each other then **T2**. Steps are **14 + 23*.
