## introduction-to-theory-of-computation (1) [3rd Sept 2023]

* TOC is nothing but mathematical representation/study of computing machine and it's capabilities.

* First mathematical model is ready and then the model is sent to algorithms(Close to programming language).
* Model -> Algorithm -> Coding
* Language -> Collection of string.
* String -> It is nothing but collection of characters.
* aabb -> It is a string. There is no meaning of it in the english language.
* Formal language -> It is also collection of strings only but meaning of the string is not important but format of the string is important.
* aabb -> Two a's followed by two b's.

* In this subject, meaning is not important but the **format is important**.
* a ^ 2 -> Two a's
* b ^ 2 -> Two b's
* a ^ 10 * b ^ 10 -> 10 a's followed by 10 b's

* Meaning is not there but format is there.
* In machine language, format is important.
* In human language, meaning is important.
* **W** is one string.
* '*' -> Combination.
* **W** is one of the strings which is a **combination(*)** of a's and b's.

* **W** is combination of a's and b's.
* Reverse of **W** is **W ^ R**.
* **L** -> Palindrome.

* Order is **important**.
