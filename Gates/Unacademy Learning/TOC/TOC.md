## introduction-to-theory-of-computation (1) [3rd Sept 2023]

* TOC is nothing but mathematical representation/study of computing machine and it's capabilities.

* First mathematical model is ready and then the model is sent to algorithms(Close to programming language).
* Model -> Algorithm -> Coding
* Language -> Collection of string.
* String -> It is nothing but collection of characters.
* aabb -> It is a string. There is no meaning of it in the english language.
* Formal language -> It is also collection of strings only but meaning of the string is not important but format of the string is important.
* aabb -> Two a's followed by two b's.

* In this subject, meaning is not important but the **format is important**.
* a ^ 2 -> Two a's
* b ^ 2 -> Two b's
* a ^ 10 * b ^ 10 -> 10 a's followed by 10 b's

* Meaning is not there but format is there.
* In machine language, format is important.
* In human language, meaning is important.
* **W** is one string.
* '*' -> Combination.
* **W** is one of the strings which is a **combination(*)** of a's and b's.

* **W** is combination of a's and b's.
* Reverse of **W** is **W ^ R**.
* **L** -> Palindrome.

* One of the formal languages where there are infinite no. of strings.
* 'n' number of a's followed by n-number of b's.
* **W** -> We can take any combinations of a's and b's.

* a's should come first and then b's should come
* Infinite language as no boundaries.
* How many a's and how many b's, no relation
* 'm'-no. of a's followed by 'n'-no. of b's.

* L = {WW} -> String Copy.
* Exact matching.
* Whatever we see **first** that same thing should be there in the **second** as well.
* No. of actual parameters = No. of formal parameters.

* Examples.
* There are **four types** of formal languages:- [According to Chomsky]

1) Type3(T3) formal language
2) Type2(T2) formal language
3) Type1(T1) formal language
4) Type0(T0) formal language

* **Type0** is the superset among all of them.
* **Type3** is the subset among all of them.

* R3 -> Smaller -> Regular Language
* T0 -> Bigger.
* Our computer program maximum can be **Type0(T0)**. No chance of more than that. It is the limitation of the computer.

* To accept smaller language(T3), smaller machine is enough.
* The smaller machine is called as **Finite Automata(Machine)**.
* Automata means **machine**.
* Finite Automata means finite machine
* Finite Automata also called as **Finite State Machine(FSM)**
* Which one is the smaller formal language?

> **T3**.
* Other name of **T3** is **regular language**.
* **Regular language** is accepted by a machine called as the **Finite Automata(Machine)**.

* Other name of **T2** is **context free language(CFL)**.
* The machines that accept **context free language(CFL)** are called as **Push Down Automata(PDA)**.

* In general,
* T3 is the **subset(C)** of **T2**.
* T_i+1 is the **subset(C)** of **T_i**.
* Type3 means Type0 also.
* By default, every/all formal languages are **Type0**.
* Every machine is a subset of **Turing machine**.
* **Circle** indicates **state**.
* Two states are **S1 and S2**.
* State -> State is nothing but the thing which can remember something. [Remembering Capability]
* State is nothing  but **Remembering Capability**
* State is changing and remembering capability is also changing.
* Nothing knows/known -> Starting State.

* Remembering capability is **increasing** so our state is **increasing**.
* Empty State -> S1 [Initial days]
* 'a' -> Mama's name
* **S2** means **a** completed
* **S1** means nothing completed.
* Same State
* If something new happened, then we may go to **other state**.

* Double Circuit(Double circle) means **final state**.
* After accepting **a**, the automata is in **final state**.
* After completing **aa**, the automata is in **final state**.

* The **automata** will accept the **above language**.
* In the automata, there are **two(2) states**.
* That's why it is called as **Finite state machine(FSM)**, it it called as **finite automata**.

* The finite automata is accepting **L1** formal language.
* Finite automata is accepting some formal language means the formal language is a **regular language**.
* Finite automata will accept **regular language** only.
* This formal language(L1) is a regular language.
* For the formal language(L1), finite automata(FA) is available so the formal language(L1) is a regular language.
