## introduction-to-theory-of-computation (1) [3rd Sept 2023]

* TOC is nothing but mathematical representation/study of computing machine and it's capabilities.

* First mathematical model is ready and then the model is sent to algorithms(Close to programming language).
* Model -> Algorithm -> Coding
* Language -> Collection of string.
* String -> It is nothing but collection of characters.
* aabb -> It is a string. There is no meaning of it in the english language.
* Formal language -> It is also collection of strings only but meaning of the string is not important but format of the string is important.
* aabb -> Two a's followed by two b's.

* In this subject, meaning is not important but the **format is important**.
* a ^ 2 -> Two a's
* b ^ 2 -> Two b's
* a ^ 10 * b ^ 10 -> 10 a's followed by 10 b's

* Meaning is not there but format is there.
* In machine language, format is important.
* In human language, meaning is important.
* **W** is one string.
* '*' -> Combination.
* **W** is one of the strings which is a **combination(*)** of a's and b's.

* **W** is combination of a's and b's.
* Reverse of **W** is **W ^ R**.
* **L** -> Palindrome.

* Order is **important**.

* Formal Language -> Set of palindromes

* One of the formal languages where there are infinite no. of strings.
* 'n' number of a's followed by n-number of b's.
* **W** -> We can take any combinations of a's and b's.

* a's should come first and then b's should come
* Infinite language as no boundaries.
* How many a's and how many b's, no relation
* 'm'-no. of a's followed by 'n'-no. of b's.

* Like these many formal languages

* L = {WW} -> String Copy.
* Exact matching.
* Whatever we see **first** that same thing should be there in the **second** as well.
* No. of actual parameters = No. of formal parameters.

* Examples.
* There are **four types** of formal languages:- [According to Chomsky]

1) Type3(T3) formal language
2) Type2(T2) formal language
3) Type1(T1) formal language
4) Type0(T0) formal language

* **Type0** is the superset among all of them.
* **Type3** is the subset among all of them.

* R3 -> Smaller
* T0 -> Bigger.
* Our computer program maximum can be **Type0(T0)**. No chance of more than that. It is the limitation of the computer.
