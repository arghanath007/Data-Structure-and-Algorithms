## Introduction (1) [8th May 2023]

> OS is another intermediate software which is **installed** on top of the hardware and with the help of the **OS** we can run various **processes** or **programs** and with the help of **OS** only, the whole computer system runs.

> We can do anything we want with the OS.

### Services of OS

* What is the most important part of OS, without which OS cannot run/function?

> Program Execution.

* Secondary memory also falls under **I/O** devices. 
* Cache memory is part of CPU. It is over CPU, to **reduce/lower** RAM access.

* File-System Manipulation -> The files/folders present in the HDD and the various operations(copy, paste, delete, update etc) which can be **performed** on them is done by the help of the OS.

## Goals of OS

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54589605/236873203-189293f1-4495-478f-a06f-f4abb2a0977f.png)

* Reliability -> Trust.
* Portability -> Hardware independent.
* Robustness -> Solve unexpected situations. Tolerant.

## Types of OS

* They are related to the **facility** of OS or they are related to **what type of computer system** we use the OS.

## Uni-programming OS

* Uni-programming OS allows only **one(1)** program to be in RAM at a time.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54589605/236877892-88aec00c-2f3f-498d-9b0e-99e9be1f5d5c.png)

* One or single program, at a time, can either use an **I/O** device or can utilize the **CPU**. Cannot use **both** at the **same** time.
* Single program cannot keep **CPU and I/O** devices busy simultaneously. 
* Not every efficient CPU utilization.

## Multi-programming OS

> This OS allows more than one program or multiple processes/programs at a time in RAM.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54589605/236962434-f03db9de-52be-4854-b594-2f3f28d7a9fb.png)

> The no. of processes the CPU can run at a time is **1** only.

> If one process was running on CPU and that process has gone for **I/O** operations then another process can use the resources of CPU. Parallel work is going on. **YES**.

> If want to use/utilize the CPU as much as possible then as many processes we have the better it is.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54589605/236963168-7c94bfe0-cefe-4a45-9c60-ea9727c9da3a.png)

* Better CPU utilization as compared to uni-porgramming OS, because if a process goes for **I/O** devices then other processes will be ready to run on the CPU. 

### Degree of Multiprogramming

* It tells at a time, how many no. of processes are there in the main memory.
* At a time there are **5** processes in **main memory** then the **degree of multiprogramming** will be **5**.
* As the **degree of multiprogramming** increases, CPU utilization also increases but upto a **certain limit**.

### Types of Multiprogramming OS

1) **Non-preemptive** -> A process can leave CPU only with it's own wish.

* Cases:-

* Either process completed
* Or process wants to use **I\O**.

> For whatever is the **external** reason, the process will never leave CPU. For any forceful reason as well, the process will never leave CPU. 

* The design of the OS is in such a way that it cannot **preempt** any running processes from the CPU. Then that OS is called as **non-preemptive multiprogramming OS**.

2) Preemptive -> A ruuning process can be taken out of CPU forcefully.


## Multi-tasking OS(Time Sharing)

> **Multi-tasking OS** is an **extension** of **preemptive multiprogramming OS**, in which processes are executed in **round-robin** manner. It is a **type** of **multiprogramming OS**.

* It is called as **Time Sharing OS** because the **time of CPU or CPU time** is being shared equally among **many processes**.

## Multi-processing OS

* It is used on computers having multiple CPUs.

### Types of Multi-processing OS

1) Tightly coupled or Shared Memory -> We have **multiple** CPUs and all of the CPUs will share a single **main memory**.
2) Loosely coupled or Distributed system -> We have **multiple** CPUs here also but all of the CPUs have their own **main memory or RAM** now. All of the CPUs will represent a **single computer system**.

* NO. Cores and CPUs are **different**. Cores means a processing unit.

## Multi-user OS

* This OS allows multiple users to use one computer system simultaneously.

## Real-time OS

* It runs on computer system which runs on real-time event or data.
* Every process get a **deadline** and each process should complete within deadline.

### Types of Real-time OS

1) Hard
2) Soft

## Embedded OS

* Used on embedded systems.

## Hand-Held OS

* OS used on devices like phones, tables, etc.
