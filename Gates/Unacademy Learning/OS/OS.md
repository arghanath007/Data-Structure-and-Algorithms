## Introduction (1) [8th May 2023]

> OS is another intermediate software which is **installed** on top of the hardware and with the help of the **OS** we can run various **processes** or **programs** and with the help of **OS** only, the whole computer system runs.

> We can do anything we want with the OS.

### Services of OS

* What is the most important part of OS, without which OS cannot run/function?

> Program Execution.

* Secondary memory also falls under **I/O** devices. 
* Cache memory is part of CPU. It is over CPU, to **reduce/lower** RAM access.

* File-System Manipulation -> The files/folders present in the HDD and the various operations(copy, paste, delete, update etc) which can be **performed** on them is done by the help of the OS.

* Reliability -> Trust.
* Portability -> Hardware independent.
* Robustness -> Solve unexpected situations. Tolerant.

## Types of OS

* They are related to the **facility** of OS or they are related to **what type of computer system** we use the OS.

## Uni-programming OS

* Uni-programming OS allows only **one(1)** program to be in RAM at a time.

* One or single program, at a time, can either use an **I/O** device or can utilize the **CPU**. Cannot use **both** at the **same** time.
* Single program cannot keep **CPU and I/O** devices busy simultaneously. 
* Not every efficient CPU utilization.

**Start from 1hr 15mins**.
