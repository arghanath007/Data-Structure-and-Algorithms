## Introduction(1)

### Alphabets

^ -> Cap Symbol
& -> AND, ampersand
* -> Asterisk
{} -> Curly braces
~ -> Tilde
| -> Pipe
\ -> Backward
/ -> Forward

## C Language Tokens and Statements(2)

* Keywords -> Pre-defined words and pre-defined usage.
* Identifiers -> user-generated words for naming things like variables.

### Operators

* Operand: 2+3; '2' and '3' are operands. '+' is the operator and more precisely a binary operator.
          * -6: '6' is operand. '-' is operator and more precisely a unary operator.
          * log x: 'x' is operand. 'log' is operator and more precisely a unary operator.


### Relational Operators

* = -> Assignment operator
* == -> Equals to operator
* != -> Not equals to.

### Left and Right Shift

#### Left Shift

* a << b. 2 << 3. 
* *Formula* -> a << b = a * 2^b.
* *Example* -> 2 << 3 = 2 * 2^3= 16(ans).

> One left shift means multiplied by 2(here), the multiplication is done 'b' times.

#### Right Shift

* a >> b. 2 >> 3. 
* *Formula* -> a >> b = (a/2^b) <- Floor Value(Integer part only). 
* *Example* -> 14 >> 2 = 14/2^2 =14/4 = 3(ans)
* 
> One right shift is divide by 2(here), the division is done 'b' times.

## Batch Statements and loops(3)

### Conditional Operator

* d= (6!=3)? (a=b) : (b=c)  [a=5,b=3,c=2]

> 6!=3 -> True, then (a=b) which is an assignment operator. The assignment operation will take place but the assigned value will not be returned to *d* as the result of the *ternary* operator, instead the *result of the assignment* will be returned to *d* as the result of the *ternary* operator.
> The result is that the assignment was completed/successful/True. If some event happens then the result will be *True or 1*.

Hence **d=1** [Since integer value of True is 1.]

* d= (a=b)? 3:5         [a=5, b=3]

> (a=b) is assignment operation and not comparison operator, which is *==*. As the assignment was successful and it happened and hence it will return *True* and the value of *a* is updated to *3* because of the assignment operator. which means *d=3 and a=3* (Ans). 

### Data Types

> The default of Data Types in C programming language is *signed*.

### Header Files

> They are library functions which are pre-written. The functions which are written along with C language.


## DPP 1 (4)

* 1 -> A (Compiler)
* 2 -> B (Double)
* 3 -> C
* 4 -> B (3)
* 5 -> C (a+b =c)
* 6 -> B 
* 7 -> A (if)
* 8 -> D (!=)
* 9 -> A (=)
* 10 -> A (&)

> Question 6, ['Associativity' comes into the picture when two or more operands have the same precedence. Here '/' and '*']

### printf() variants

* printf("%d", printf("program")); -> program7

> The word 'program' gets printed. *printf* counts the number of characters that it has printed. So printf counts the length of the characters. These count of the characters will be printed after the word 'program' which was already printed.

* For C programming there are at-least 60 different compilers for it where we can run c language code.

### Structure of C-programming language

> *main() function* -> library function. It is already given. It is to be written in every program. It is mandatory/necessary to be written in every program. Without main(), we cannot write a C-program which we want to execute because execution of a C-programs starts from the main() itself.


* **%u** -> It is used for **unsigned** values.
* 


## DPP 2 

* 1 -> B
* 2 -> A
* 3 -> D
* 4 -> C
* 5 -> C
* 6 -> B
* 7 -> A
* 8 -> A
* 9 -> C
* 10 -> D
* 11 -> C
* 12 -> E
* 13 -> B
* 14 -> B



* *%lu* ->Unsigned int or unsigned long

### Break and continue (5)

*Break and Continue* -> They are **loop controlling statements** and not branch controlling statements.

* *Break* -> It breaks the current loop.
* *Continue* -> It skips/stops the current iteration of the loop and goes to the next iteration.


## DPP 2.1

* 1 -> B
* 2 -> A
* 3 -> E
* 4 -> C
* 5 -> D
* 6 -> C
* 7 -> D
* 8 -> 
* 9 -> B
* 10 -> D
