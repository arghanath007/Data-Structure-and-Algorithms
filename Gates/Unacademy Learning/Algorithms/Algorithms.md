> Algorithm is a combination of sequence of finite steps to solve a problem.

> Combination of some(finite) statements.

> Algorithms is a generic programming language. From one language to another language, syntax will change a little bit.

> After writing the **algorithm**, we can write it in some **programming language** also.

> Algorithm is for **humans**. If we write the algorithm in some **programming language** then the computer will understand.

> We will first write **algorithm** then we will write **program**.

> We have an **algorithm** and we want to convert it into a **programming language**, the programming language we will **choose/prefer** depends on the **use case or what problem it is solving**.

## Programming of Algorithm

> Finite steps doesn't mean finite time.

> It is a program but not an algorithm. Every algorithm is a **program** but every program is not an **algorithm**. Program may halt and may not halt. Program is a **turing machine**. For a problem, algorithm is possible which means **HTM or halt turing machine** is possible.

> Algorithm possible means program possible. Program possible doesn't mean algorithm possible. Program contains **infinite loop**.

* Difference between algo and program?

> Program may stop and may not stop. It may go to **infinite loop**. Algorithm has to **stop**. So, algorithm is a **HTM or halt turing machine**.

* Algorithm -> **HTM or halt turing machine** -> It will terminate after finite time.
* Program -> **Turing machine**

1) It should terminate after finite time
2) It should provide atleast one output
3) It should be deterministic
4) Every statement in algo should be effective
5) It is independent of **programming language**.


## Steps to design algorithm for given problem

> With them procedures if we construct an algorithm then the properties are satisfied.

1) Problem Definition
2) Select designing technique
3) Draw Flowchart
4) Testing
5) Implementation means coding
6) Analysis

> We have **3** designing technique in the syllabus, **Divide and conquor, Greedy and Dynamic programming**. There are **2** more which are not in syllabus, **Backtracking, branch and bound**.

## Analysis

1) Finding Time and space complexity
2)

> Better solution will be provided by **analysis**. If **time complexity** is **same** then go for **space complexity**.

> If the question, simply asks for **which is better**?

* Then give chance to **time** first.

> If the problem having more than one algo?

* Then, the **best one** is decided based on **time complexity(CPU time)** and **space complexity(Main memory)**.

## Time Complexity

* 'p' is a program 
* Time complexity or T(p) = Compile time or C(p) + Running time or R(p).

> **Time complexity of a program** is **based/dependent** on the **language of the compiler and type of processor**.

## Types of Analysis

1) **Aposteriori analysis** -> **Based/Dependent** on the **language of the compiler and type of processor**. Exact answer. Computer-computer time complexity changes.
2) **Apriori analysis** -> **Independent** of the **language of the compiler and type of processor**. Appropriate answer. Same answer in every computer.

> According to **Apriori analysis**, everyone cannot buy **super computer** but everyone can write **super algorithm** because god gave **same  brain** to all.

> Some poeple use it effictively and some not. Some people believe in themselves and some not.

## Apriori analysis

> Instead of saying **best logic**, they are saying it in some other way like **employee of the month**.

> It is a determination of order of magnitude of a statement.

> It is **indirectly** talking about **logic**.


> While running, the statement will run only **once or one time only**. This **once or one time** is called as **order of magnitude**.

> **Order of magnitude** of a statement means that while running **the statement will be executed by the processor for how many times**. So add **theta** to it  and it will be like **theta(1)** then it is called as the **time complexity**.
 
 > The **order of magnitude** with **theta symbol** is called as **time complexity**.

> Every **constant** can be represented as **theta(1)**.

> **1** will be **executed** once only.

> So, time complexity is **theta(n)**. We are ignoring the  **small constant**. **Small constant** are nothing but **processor's speed**.

> We don't need to go **inside**. It still gives the **same analysis**.
