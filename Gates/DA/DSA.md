* Time Complexity -> It can be **fast or slow**.
* Time complexity is the **value** which is defining in **how much time(fast or slow)** will be get the **output**.
* Foundation of **DSA** is **time complexity** only.

* **main()** is the starting point of the program.
* Constant Time(CT).
* Variable Time(VT).
* Constant time -> O(1) [Big O]
* Notion.

* **O(1)** is the set of all constants. [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* For the no. of statements which is **100**, that is **constant(C)** and for **constant no. of statements**, we will have **constant time(CT)**. **Constant time(CT)** is handled by **O(1)**.

* For loop.

* The **n** in the for loop is **variable(v)** as we don't know the value of **n**. It is not **constant(C)**.

* Time Complexity is **O(n)** because **n** is **variable(v)**.

* We cannot put **constants** with the **variables** within the **Big O** notation. We have to put the **variables** only within the **Big O** notation. [**IMPORTANT**]

* We are comparing **2^k** with **n**. So in place of **2^k** we can write **n**.
* log n = k.
* If we take **log** of the **left side** then we will get the **right side**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* This is **logarithmic relation** or **log**.
* The whole game is based on **log**.

* **While** loop will keep on running the **code** till the **condition** is **True**, as soon as the condition is **false** then the **while** loop stops.
* WLM -> While Loop Moves. 
* We have performed **3 divisions** so we have run the loop for **3 times**.

* Time Complexity of the program is **log n**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* The **log** is coming because of the **division property** and not because of the **while** loop.

* Ending Point(EP) -> Destination(D)
* Move or movement(M).

* Everytime we are **multiplying '2'** with the **previous value**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* The time complexity will be **O(log n)**.

* The time complexity is not dependent on the **while or for** loops, it is **dependent** on the **conditions** within the loops. [**IMPORTANT**]
* SDM -> Source(S), Destination(D) and Movement(M)
* The time complexity will be **dependent/determined** by the **SDM** of the loops(for/while).

 * The advantage of **arrangement** is that we are **saving time, proper arrangement of things**. So the overall **time complexity** is **reduced**.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/0279fd62-ad8b-42de-bf87-3de199a5ad6e)

* Data structuring is **directly** related to **time**.
* Data structuring varies from program to program.

1) Slots should be continious.
2) Similar data should be placed.

1) We must know the index where we put the data.
2) If the slots are void then just go to that room and place the value **x**. It always takes **constant** amount of time which is **O(1)**.

* If we want to do **insertion** in an array then it would be **constant** amount of time which is **O(1)** time.

* To insert the element 25 at location 2, we have used up **3 units** of time.

![image](https://github.com/arghanath007/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/assets/54589605/7b44d732-14d6-4954-bcfc-5ca90d9db422)

* We have **100** rooms and **99** rooms are filled. We have to insert the **98** no in the **1st** room. The last or the **100th** room is **empty**. So we will shift all of the **99 elements** by **1** place to the **right** so that the **1st** room will be **empty** and now we can place the **98** no at the **1st** place.
* We have to do right shift on the **99** numbers.
* **99 units** for shifting the **99** nos and **1 unit** for placing the **98** no at the **1st** place.
* So total time taken is **99 + 1 -> 100** units of time.

* We don't have to scan the **left part** now.
* We have to scan the **right part** only.

* 1st attempt -> 30.
* 2nd attempt -> 50.
* 3rd attempt -> 60.
* After **3 attempts/comparisons** we will then get the no which we want which is **60**. [**IMPORTANT**]

* We don't have to scan the **n/2** elements on the **left side** of the **mid element** which is **a**.
* Either we will reject the whole **left portion** or we will reject the whole **right portion**.

* We are always **dividing by 2**.
* After **log n** time we will get from **'n' to '1'**.

* In **sorted array** we need only **log n** time in the **worst case**. [**IMPORTANT**]

* **Binary search** is always in **sorted order**. It's time is **log n**.

* All of the rooms have their own **addresses and indexes**.

* Filling the entire array with **values**.
* Time to fill the array would be **O(n)**.
