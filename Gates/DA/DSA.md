* Time Complexity -> It can be **fast or slow**.
* Time complexity is the **value** which is defining in **how much time(fast or slow)** will be get the **output**.
* Foundation of **DSA** is **time complexity** only.

* **main()** is the starting point of the program.
* Constant Time(CT).
* Variable Time(VT).
* Constant time -> O(1) [Big O]
* Notion.

* **O(1)** is the set of all constants. [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* For the no. of statements which is **100**, that is **constant(C)** and for **constant no. of statements**, we will have **constant time(CT)**. **Constant time(CT)** is handled by **O(1)**.

* For loop.

* The **n** in the for loop is **variable(v)** as we don't know the value of **n**. It is not **constant(C)**.

* Time Complexity is **O(n)** because **n** is **variable(v)**.

* We cannot put **constants** with the **variables** within the **Big O** notation. We have to put the **variables** only within the **Big O** notation. [**IMPORTANT**]

* Time Complexity is **O(n ^ 2)**.

* Time Complexity is **O(n ^ 3)**.

* The source is **2 ^ 3** and the destination is **2 ^ 0**.
* The no. of division will be **3 and 5**.

* We are comparing **2^k** with **n**. So in place of **2^k** we can write **n**.
* log n = k.
* If we take **log** of the **left side** then we will get the **right side**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* This is **logarithmic relation** or **log**.
* The whole game is based on **log**.

* **While** loop will keep on running the **code** till the **condition** is **True**, as soon as the condition is **false** then the **while** loop stops.
* WLM -> While Loop Moves. 
* We have performed **3 divisions** so we have run the loop for **3 times**.

* Time Complexity of the program is **log n**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* The **log** is coming because of the **division property** and not because of the **while** loop.

* Why **log n** is coming. [**VERY IMPORTANT**]

* Starting Point(SP) -> Source(S)
* Ending Point(EP) -> Destination(D)
* Move or movement(M).
* Everytime we are **doubling** the value.

* Divide by 2.
* Multiply by 2.

* Everytime we are **multiplying '2'** with the **previous value**. [**IMPORTANT**]
* The time complexity will be **O(log n)**.

* The time complexity is not dependent on the **while or for** loops, it is **dependent** on the **conditions** within the loops. [**IMPORTANT**]
* SDM -> Source(S), Destination(D) and Movement(M)
* The time complexity will be **dependent/determined** by the **SDM** of the loops(for/while).
