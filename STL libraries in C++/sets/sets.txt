Maps -> Key-value pairs
Sets -> It is like a map without any values. It is a set of values. Collection of elements.The values stored in a set are unique. 


1)Normal Set:-

    1)Stored in sorted order. 
    2)Sets are implemented using Trees.

    3)Time Complexity of Normal Set:-

        1)Accessing and inserting elements in a set is O(log n).
        2) find() is O(log n)

    4) Complex data types like vectors, pair, etc. can also be used as keys because normal maps use trees.



2)Unordered Set:- 

    1) It is used when the ordering doesn't matter and we need to find something within that data.
    2) Time Complexity of Normal Set:-

        1)Accessing and inserting elements in a set is O(1).
        2) find() is O(1)

    3) They are not stored in sorted order.
    4) They are implemented using Hash tables.
    5) Basic data types like int, string, double, float, char, etc. can be used as keys as they have hash tables. Complex data types like vectors, pair, etc. cannot be used as keys as they don't have hash tables defined.    


3) Multi Set:-

    1)Stored in sorted order. 
    2)Multi Set are implemented using Trees.
    3)Time Complexity of Normal Set:-

        1)Accessing and inserting elements in a set is O(log n).
        2) find() is O(log n)

    4) It can store duplicates of the same element.
    5) It is mainly used in graphs where priorityqueue is used.
