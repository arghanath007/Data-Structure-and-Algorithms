2)**Encapsulation** is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.

3)**Inheritance** is an important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class.
